# "INSTILL-COMPLETION"("1")


## NAME



instill-completion - Generate shell completion scripts 

## SYNOPSIS



**instill completion -s ** 

## DESCRIPTION



Generate shell completion scripts for Instill CLI commands. 

When installing Instill CLI through a package manager, it's possible that no additional shell configuration is necessary to gain completion support. For Homebrew, see https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion \[la]https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion\[ra] 

If you need to set up completions manually, follow the instructions below. The exact config file locations might vary based on your system. Make sure to restart your shell before testing whether completions are working. 

### bash



First, ensure that you install ****bash-completion using your package manager. 

After, add this to your ****~/.bash\_profile: 



    
```
eval "$(instill completion -s bash)"

```


### zsh



Generate a ****\_instill completion script and put it somewhere in your ****$fpath: 



    
```
instill completion -s zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_instill

```


Ensure that the following is present in your ****~/.zshrc: 



    
```
autoload -U compinit
compinit -i

```


Zsh version 5.7 or later is recommended. 

### fish



Generate a ****instill.fish completion script: 



    
```
instill completion -s fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/instill.fish

```


### PowerShell



Open your profile script with: 



    
```
mkdir -Path (Split-Path -Parent $profile) -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
notepad $profile

```


Add the line and save the file:
