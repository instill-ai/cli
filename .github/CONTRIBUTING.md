# Contributing Guidelines

Hello! Your interest in contributing to our codebase is greatly appreciated.

## How to Contribute

Beyond discussions and issues, we also value code contributions to our open-source projects. To get involved:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Begin by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch to house your work. Use a clear and descriptive name, like `feat/<your-feature-name>`.
3. **Make and Commit Changes:** Implement your changes and commit them. We encourage you to follow these best practices for commits to ensure an efficient review process:
    - Adhere to the [conventional commits guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for meaningful commit messages.
    - Follow the [7 rules of commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for well-structured and informative commits.
    - Rearrange commits to squash trivial changes together, if possible. Utilize [git rebase](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/03/20/reorder-commits-with-rebase.html) for this purpose.
4. **Push to Your Branch:** Push your branch to your GitHub repository: `git push origin feat/<your-feature-name>`.
5. **Open a Pull Request:** Initiate a pull request to our repository. Our team will review your changes and collaborate with you on any necessary refinements.

Your contributions make a difference. Let's build something amazing together!
